# SkipList

My implementation of a SkipList from one of my university assignments.  

User runs the app from the cli and provides the input directly from there. 

Inputs vary depending on the object methods you are planning to invoke. 

Object methods inlcude skipInsert(), dump(), remove(), removeByCoords(), skipSearchAndReturn().

Additonal Details:

The goal of this assignment was to allow the user to input a command(str), name(str), x-axis(str(number)), y-axis(str(number)), width(str(number)), length(str(number)).

The command represents the method that will be called from the object.

The name is the name by which we'll refer to the rectangle.

The 4 number coordinates are meant to represent the dimensions of the rectangle.
